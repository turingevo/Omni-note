**‚ú® Core Features: Smart, Efficient, Ready-to-Use**  
- **1. Real-Time Content Generation**: Enter prompts in the frontend command bar; the backend intelligently schedules large models and streams responses for millisecond-level real-time interaction.  
- **2. Vision-Driven Copywriting**: Leverages image recognition technology to accurately extract visual information (e.g., travel scenes) and generate high-quality, context-aware text on demand‚Äîempowering creative workflows.  
- **3. Professional Speech Transcription**: Supports ultra-long audio recognition (e.g., meeting recordings or lecture notes) with high-precision transcription, fulfilling essential voice-to-text note-taking needs.  
- **4. On-Device Instant Image Generation**: Requires no high-end hardware‚Äîefficient inference runs entirely on CPU to quickly generate large-size images, enabling lightweight creation anytime, anywhere.  
- **5. Intelligent Knowledge Base Management**: Integrates note summarization, semantic search, and Q&A-based review. Retrieve information with one click and significantly boost knowledge reuse efficiency.  
- **6. Extensible Agent Platform**: Built on an MCP (Multi-agent Collaboration Protocol)-based architecture, it supports a rich ecosystem of AI assistants (e.g., customer service, writing, data analysis) and flexibly adapts to both enterprise and personal needs.  
- **7. Model Agnostic Switching**: Decouples notes from models, enabling seamless compatibility with mainstream services like OpenAI API. Switch models with one click and lower the barrier to entry.


**üõ°Ô∏è Core Advantages: Powerful, Secure, Effortless**  
- **1. Robust Multimodal Processing**  
  Supports all data types‚Äîtext, speech, images, and video‚Äîwith highly automated handling. Knowledge base Q&A is precise and efficient, making information retrieval and review effortless.  

- **2. Ultimate Security**  
  **100% local deployment**: No internet connection required. End-to-end encryption from frontend to database ensures complete data privacy, eliminating cloud leakage risks‚Äîideal for sensitive scenarios such as finance and healthcare.  

- **3. Ultra-Low Compute Requirements**  
  Runs smoothly on CPU-only devices using high-precision low-bit quantization technology, achieving **>50% faster inference**‚Äîeven legacy hardware can efficiently handle AI tasks.  

- **4. Flexible Deployment Architecture**  
  Client-Server (C/S) architecture supports three deployment modes:  
    - Personal Computer: Single-machine private deployment‚Äîinstall and use immediately.  
    - Local Area Network (LAN): Enterprise intranet solution for multi-user collaborative office work.  
    - Cloud Collaboration: Hybrid edge-cloud deployment with cross-platform support for phones, tablets, and computers‚Äîensuring seamless data sync.  

- **5. High Extensibility**  
  Extend AI capabilities via the MCP protocol (e.g., intelligent recruitment, data analysis, financial reporting). Switch freely by use case‚Äîno development required.  

- **6. Standardized API Compatibility**  
  Unified interfaces compatible with industry-leading services for seamless ecosystem integration:

| Functional Module       | API Standard               |
|-------------------------|----------------------------|
| Vision-Language    | OpenAI API format          |
| Speech Recognition      | FUNASR API format          |
| Image Generation        | Stable Diffusion API format|
| Embedding          | OpenAI Embedding API format|
| Reranker           | Jina AI Rerank API format  |
